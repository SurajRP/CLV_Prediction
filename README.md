# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
Throughout the years, companies from several business sectors have strived to strengthen their client portfolio by acquiring and retaining the most profitable. For this to happen, current and potential clients must be clearly classified based on their past and future interactions with a company throughout the lifetime of their relationship and it can be done with the help of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). It is one of the key metrics in marketing and is considered an important segmentation base. The dataset is derived from IBM Watson Marketing Customer Value. This project studies the capabilities of a range of models to predict CLV in the insurance industry. We examined the dataset to get fruitful insights which will help the insurance companies to get hold of profitable customers. It presents a detailed empirical evaluation of how accurately the future profitability of customers can be estimated.
